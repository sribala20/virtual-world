[CSC- 203] Project-Based Object Oriented Programming

[DESCRIPTION] -
In this virtual world, there are Dude entities that chop trees and return to their homes once full. The fairies in the world immediately move to the chopped trees and regrow them. If you click anywhere in the world, a dam will spawn and a beaver will crawl out and start chopping trees into holes that cannot be regrown. The dude closest to the spawned beaver will become angry and chase the beaver; the dude returns to their normal tasks once the beaver is dealt with. 

[INVOLVEMENT] -
I began by refactoring a large code base to increase cohesion and remove duplicate code. Then, I coded an improved pathing algorithm (A*) for several of the entities. I also worked with a classmate to add new functionality to our world. I drew the holes, dams, and angry dude frames and coded the behaviors for the angry dude and the mouse clicking.
