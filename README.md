# Virtual World   
In this virtual world, there are Dude entities that chop trees and return to their homes once full. The fairies in the world immediately move to the chopped trees and regrow them. If you click anywhere in the world, a dam will spawn and a beaver will crawl out and start chopping trees into holes that cannot be regrown. The dude closest to the spawned beaver will become angry and chase the beaver; the dude returns to their normal tasks once the beaver is dealt with.  
*run instructions:* Run VirtualWorld.java

**ACTION:**  
I refactored a large code base to increase cohesion and remove duplicate code. Then, I programmed an improved pathing algorithm (A-star) for several of the entities. I also worked with a friend to add new functionality to our world. I created pixel art for the holes, dams, and angry dude frames and coded the methods for the angry dude and the mouse clicking changes.

**TAKEAWAYS:**  
This was my first project dealing with a large codebase. I improved in my abilities to quickly understand the purpose of a chunk of code and I applied my knowledge of OOP principles. I learned how to work carefully and incrementally by using a UML Diagram to plan out my classes and methods. I also became more familiar with how to debug in a larger codebase. This project has prepared me to tackle challenges with large, complex codebases, which I will work with in nearly all  future software engineering positions.
